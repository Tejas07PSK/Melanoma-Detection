# MELANOMA-DETECTION
###### What is Melanoma?
**_'Melanoma'_**, also known as **_'Malignant_Melanoma'_**, is a type
of cancer that develops from the pigment-containing cells known
as _melanocytes_. Melanomas typically occur on the skin, but may rarely
occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye. The primary cause of
melanoma is ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in those with low levels of
skin pigment. The UV light may be from either the sun or from other
sources, such as tanning devices. About 25% develop from moles.
